      <h2>Today's goal</h2>
      <p>Dataset for the first assignment of the course
        Each student should use ITS OWN dataset, DO NOT use someone's else file, search for the folder that has your
        GitHub username.
        <br>The goal is the following:
        <li>Parse the file, find the valid rows (i.e., the rows for which both rules are satisfied, as described below).
        </li>
        <li>Create a GitHub page that displays using p5.js the following information:
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean" target="_blank">Mean</a> of the first column</li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation" target="_blank">Standard deviation</a> of the second column</li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)" target="_blank">Mode</a> of the third column</li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median" target="_blank">Median</a> of the fourth column</li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean" target="_blank">Mean</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation">Standard deviation</a> of the fifth column</li>
        You must provide two graphical and two textual representations. You can decide which information is shown in
        which
        modality. The fifth and final representation is up to you. For example, as a graphical representation, you could
        plot a circle whose size depends on the mean of the first column.
        <br>To identify the valid rows of the dataset:
        Read the rules that are written in the rules.txt file (again, each student will have ITS OWN rules.txt file!)
        <br>A row is considered valid if both rules are valid at the same time.
        <br>Example:
        <br>1. rule1 -> column0 > 0
        <br>2. rule2 -> column1 < -5 * 5,-2,1,2,3 is a valid row since both rules are valid * -1,-1,3,4,5 is not a valid
          row since column0 is negative and thus rule1 is not satisfied. * 5,1,4,5,7 is not a valid row since column1 is
          greater than 0 and thus rule2 is not satisfied. * -2,3,9,0,1 is not a valid row since neither of the rules are
          satisfied.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="colonna" id="seconda">
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>1. column3 is integer 30 <= x < 42 <br>2. column2 > 60</p>
      <p>starting rows: <span id="totalRows"></span></p>
      <p>rows after slection: <span id="validRows"></span></p>

    <div>
      <h2>Statistics</h2>
      <p>Mean of column 0: <span id="mean0"></span></p>
      <p>Standard deviation of column 1: <span id="std1"></span></p>
      <p>Mode of column 2: <span id="mode2"></span></p>
      <p>Median of column 3: <span id="median3"></span></p>
      <p>Mean of column 4: <span id="mean4"></span></p>
      <p>Standard deviation of column 4: <span id="std4"></span></p>
